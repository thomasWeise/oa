Optimization is the art of finding good solutions for problems that are hard to solve.
From Logistics, the scheduling of work in a factory or the lectures of students, the packing of objects into bins, over the design of rotor wings to the synthesis of dynamic controllers for engines -- all involve, implicitly or explicitly, optimization.
In this book we explore this very wide field.
We look at it from the perspective of a programmer.
We try to find define a pattern common to most optimization problems and then we explore how algorithms can be designed on basis of this pattern.
We step-by-step investigate more and more complicated optimization approaches and learn lessons along the way.
This book follows a very practical approach.
We focus less on theory and more on learning-by-doing and trial-and-error {\dots} which, coincidentally, is very similar to how many of the algorithms that we will study work as well.
