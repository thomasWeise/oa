# Optimization Algorithms

## 1. Introduction

**Download our book from <https://thomasweise.github.io/oa/optimization_algorithms.pdf>.**

With the book *"[Optimization Algorithms](https://thomasweise.github.io/oa/optimization_algorithms.pdf)"* we try to develop an accessible and easy-to-read introduction to optimization, optimization algorithms, and, in particular, metaheuristics.
We will do this by first building a general framework structure for optimization problems.
We then approach the algorithms that have been developed to solve such problems from bottom-up, starting with simple approaches and step-by-step moving to more advanced methods.
